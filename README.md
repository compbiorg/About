# About
Welcome to the Github Repository for the Center for the Computational Biology, Uganda Christian University. We are located at the Medical School of the Uganda Christian University.

The Center is an affiliate of the Makerere University/UVRI Infection and Immunity Research Training Programme (MUII plus). You can learn about MUII plus by visiting https://www.uvri.go.ug/projects/muii-plus

# Motivation
Use of mathematical and computational methods is becoming an integral part of biological research. Recent technological developments in biological science for example, next generation sequencing coupled with the reduction in cost and turn-around time of sequencing have led to a massive increase in the amounts of data generated. Previously, statistics departments were the go-to avenues for processing and analyzing data from research studies. However, these departments have fallen short with the realization that making sense of these large amounts of complex biological data requires strong quantitative skills. While the developed world has tried to cope with these trends, African research programmes are still lacking in terms of capacity to analyze such enormous data. As such, a small proportion of the data obtained is analyzed internally and the other by external collaborators from the developed world. In addition, skills in Mathematical Modeling so as to inform timely, evidence-based decision making in disease control and prevention are generally lacking in Africa. In light of the above, we created a Center for Computational Biology at the Uganda Christian University so as to perform high quality computational research and to redress the capacity deficit in Africa. There is a need for a coordinated effort so as to effect change.

# Vision
Our vision is to become a world leader in quality computational biology research.

# Objectives
1.	To perform high quality computational health research, with a focus on mathematical modeling and genomics. 
2.	To give ‘policy related’ second opinion modeling to government and industry.
3.	To build a strong quantitative team of computational biologists in Africa so as to redress the capacity problem and provide a focus for computational biology in Uganda and Africa at large by
(i)	Pooling together African scientists with quantitative skills.
(ii) Giving quantitative training to other African scientists.
(iii) Mentoring young scientists in computational research.
(iv) Building strong partnerships with other centers of excellence in computational reserach all over the world.
